# A Simple Base64 Example in JavaScript, HTML and CSS

This is a very simple example that demonstrates the use of atob() and btoa() JavaScript functions combined with HTML and formatted with CSS.

# What is JavaScript?

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding system that converts binary data into an ASCII string format that can be printed. It’s frequently used to represent data in a way that’s safe for transmission across text-based protocols. This encoding allows binary data, such as images or files, to be communicated as text characters in an efficient manner. Understanding Base64 is essential in JavaScript for a variety of data processing activities and web development applications.

# Base64 in JavaScript

<li><b>btoa():</b> This function takes a binary string as an argument and returns a Base64-encoded ASCII string. It is used to encode data that may otherwise cause communication problems, so it can be transmitted safely.</li>

<li><b>atob():</b> This function takes a Base64-encoded ASCII string as an argument and returns the original binary string. It is used to decode data that has been encoded using the btoa() function.</li>
